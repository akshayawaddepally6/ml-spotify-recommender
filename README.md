# 🎧 Spotify Recommendation System

This project implements a content-based recommendation system that suggests new songs tailored to your Spotify playlists. By analyzing the audio features of your existing playlist tracks, it identifies and recommends songs with similar characteristics, enhancing your music discovery experience.

---

## 📌 Features

* **Playlist-Based Recommendations**: Input any of your Spotify playlists to receive song suggestions that align with its musical profile.
* **Audio Feature Analysis**: Utilizes Spotify's audio features (e.g., danceability, energy, tempo) to understand and match song characteristics.
* **Content-Based Filtering**: Employs cosine similarity on TF-IDF vectors derived from song features to find tracks similar to those in your playlist.
* **Interactive Visualizations**: Provides visual insights into the recommendation process, including similarity matrices and feature distributions.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python**: Core programming language for data processing and analysis.
* **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for developing and presenting the recommendation engine.
* **Spotipy**: Python library for accessing the Spotify Web API.
* **pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and numerical computations.
* **scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for implementing TF-IDF vectorization and similarity calculations.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization libraries for plotting and analysis.
